# Anti Mindblock tool
I remade Shikkesora's osu! Anti Mindblock tool for Linux.

Known issues:
- All monitors flip on multi-monitor setups
- Bad UI

You might need to download dependencies in order for this program to work (search how to download them for your distro):
- tkinter
- pynput

Installation:
- Download the .zip file from Releases
- Unzip the archive
- Run Anti_Mindblock/main.dist/main.bin

Implementation:
- Create a new .desktop file

- Open it in your text editor of choice and paste this text and edit the path in "Exec" to match yours:
  ```
  [Desktop Entry]
  Type=Application
  Name=Anti Mindblock
  Comment=Tool for removing mindblock in osu!
  Exec=/home/jakub/Documents/github/anti-mindblock/main.dist/main.bin
  Categories=Games;
  ```
- After saving, make sure to make the file executable

- Open a terminal in the same location
- Move the .desktop file to /usr/share/applications/
  ```
  sudo mv AntiMindblock.desktop /usr/share/applications/
  ```
- Anti Mindblock should now be available as an entry
